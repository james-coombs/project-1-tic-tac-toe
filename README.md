Web Development Immersive Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

https://james-coombs.github.io/project-1-tic-tac-toe/

For this project I used multiple technologies:
-git
-github
-JQuery
-ajax
-css
-sass
-bootstrap
-HTML
-curl
-javascript

My planning began with a wireframe based off of the project requirements. This wireframe was used to reference the basic
features required for the assignment. I planned to create a basic page layout, create user account functionality, greate game logic and then create game/server interaction.
Planning then moved to the design and creation of the HTML. Once a basic page was created,
I began work on user accounts and login. I initally used curl to create a user account. Once my account was created I implimented
ajax request for the user actions of 'POST', 'PATCH' and 'DELETE'.
Game logic and game/server interaction were worked on simultaneiously. Many problems arose during this point in development.
Many issues were solved by breaking features and requirements down to a granular level; focusing on one problem of one piece of code at a time. Some issues, such as win conditions, were solved by 'brute force' logic.

There are unsolved problems which I would like to fixed in the future.
-Improving UX/UI
-Allowing past game retrevial to re-populate the board

User stories created before development began:
As a Player, I want to play tic tac toe, so that I can compete against a friend.
As a User, I want to register an account, so that I can save and track my games.
As a Developer, I want to interact with a bug-free web app, so that I can see how it all works.
As a Player, I want to be clearly notified of the end game state, so that I know the outcome of the game.
As a User, I want to View my past game data, so that I can see my performance over time.
As a Player, I want to Re-Open old games that I saved, so that I can continue my progress.
